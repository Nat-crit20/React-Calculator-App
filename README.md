## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to deploy a react app to Github Pages. I also learned about how to use props and hooks in React and I also learned about how to style with.

### Continued development

I would like to style the radio buttons better and get remove the NaN error that pops up in the display. For the future I would like to implement a formula type calculate, because the one that I have right now it pretty basic.
